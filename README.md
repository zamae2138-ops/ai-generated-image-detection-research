# ai-generated-image-detection-research

This project was completed as part of the Concordia College Innovation Challenge (Jan–Apr 2025). The goal was to investigate why people struggle to identify AI-generated images and explore potential technical approaches to improve detection.

## Problem
As AI-generated imagery becomes increasingly realistic, individuals face growing difficulty distinguishing authentic images from synthetic ones, raising concerns around misinformation, trust, and security.

## Approach
Worked in a multidisciplinary team to analyze perceptual and technical boundary conditions affecting AI image detection. Proposed the use of AI-driven eye-tracking and pattern recognition methods to study user attention and visual inconsistencies.

## Outcome
The project earned **2nd place recognition** for technical insight and innovative research approach.

## Skills & Tools
- Research design
- Human perception analysis
- AI ethics & trust
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Technical concept development
